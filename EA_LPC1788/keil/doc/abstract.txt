 This project in an example of how to use the graphics library
 functions from NXP called SWIM (Simple Window Interface Manager).
 
 Required hardware:
 	EA LPC1788 OEM board
	EA OEM Base Board rev. A
	EA QVGA 320x240 LCD module v2.3
	EA QVGA Display Adapter rev. A
	
 Required Software:
 	Keil uVision v4.x or newer
	
 Description:
 	Draws color bars on the LCD using the SWIM library with LCD in RGB:1555 mode.

 Notes:
 	The display module is connected to the EA OEM Base Board using an adapter
	containing several jumpers. The CFG1 through CFG4 jumpers need to be set
	up like so:
	CFG1 H
	CFG2 L
	CFG3 L
	CFG4 L
	There is a jumper labeled PWM / SHDN. This should be in the SHDN position.


 	The LPC1788 OEM Board board has external SDRAM using an ISSI IS42S32800D

	This memory will be used as the LCD frame buffer memory for this example.
	
	The SDRAM memory resides at address:
		0xA0000000 - 0xA1FFFFFF using DYNCS0 (32MB, 8Mx32)
	
	in 240x320 16bpp RGB:1555 mode the the frame buffer uses 150KB starting at: 
		0xA0000000 within the SDRAM.
	
	The Truly LCD module on the EA-2478 board contains a complete
	LCD controller module with it's own frame buffer as well as
	a hardware touchscreen controller. This example disables the
	LCD controller and frame buffer on the Truly module and places
	the LCD module into a dumb RGB1555 mode. The SPI interface to the
	module is used to program the module into this mode.  

	The parameters for the Truly LCD panel are configured in lcd_params.c

  1) Start Keil uVision4 for ARM and open the example project file

      Project->Open Project..
      Open the following project: swim.Uvproj
	  Ensure that 565 mode is selected in the lpc_colors.h file
	  
	  #define COLORS_DEF 16      /* 16-bit 565 color mode */

  2) Build the project
  
      Project->Build Target
      
  3) Attach your ULink2 debugger to the EA-LPC1788 OEM board & PC
  
  4) Download the program into flash

      Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)

  5) Run the program !

      Debug->Run (F5)
